## Overview

For my first project, I chose to create a jeopardy gameboard. After the user navigates to the URL for the game's website, the game will start once the user selects one of the boxes with a point value on it.  Once a game piece is selected, the player will see the question and an input field for the answer in an alert box.  The total score can go up or down depending on whether the question is answered correctly or incorrectly.  Once a question has been answered, the point value on the game piece will disappear, and the question can no longer be answered.


## Technology Used

* Languages - HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, jQuery
* Project Planning and User Stories  - [Trello](https://trello.com/b/J5TmVQe1/jeopardy-game-workflow)

## Wireframe

I used this resource to create what I wanted the site and each question/answer prompt to look like from the user standpoint.

## Features

* Score keeper
* Once a question has been answered, the gamepiece is no longer available to play until the player hits refresh.

## Future Improvements

* Add a reset button
* Make the game site responsive
* Include more categories and questions
* Add a timer for each question
* The ability for users to select from a drop down list of answers to chose from after a game piece has been selected.
